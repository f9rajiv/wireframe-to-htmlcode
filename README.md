               AUTOMATIC HTML CODE GENERATOR USING LSTM

An early stage of developing web applications is creating a wireframe to layout the
interface. Once a wireframe has been created it is given to a developer to implement in
code. Developing a full phase user interface code is time consuming work but still requires
an experienced developer. In this project we present two approaches which automate this
process, feature extraction using CNN and sequence memorizing using LSTM. We will
release a dataset of websites which can be used to train and evaluate these approaches.
Automatic HTML code generator system uses two types of dataset one is wireframe
sketches and other is its associated HTML code.
